### Challenge
One of the world’s leading science and technology companies in healthcare had to maintain its position at 
the forefront by constantly evolving its existing business models as well as company culture towards a more 
agile and innovation-driven organization. Given the vast changing digital ecosystem, they sought a solution, 
which accelerates the organization’s (internal) innovation sourcing by actively empowering and involving 
employees in the innovation cycle through an idea-submission-platform.


### Solution
The project scope was to build a responsive web app, which should enable and motivate the employees to come 
up with new (digital) business ideas of their own. The platform components include three main modules: a 
strategic framework exercise, business model builder and a milestone planner. The tool/platform streamlines 
input formats supported by examples, in order to help its employees to enhance their articulation/structuring 
of business/product ideas, so that senior leadership gets accustomed to one single idea submission format, 
which should increase the likelihood of ideas actually being reviewed, considered and finally executed. Once 
the solution has gained positive feedback internally, the product should be released to private customers (B2C) 
and to other companies (B2B / white labeling).
