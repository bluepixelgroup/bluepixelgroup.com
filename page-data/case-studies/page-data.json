Existing free proxy solutions don't always work or they track users online and use their personal data for monetization.\n<br>\n<br>\nYournet proposes a proxy solution where the users provide no personal data and there is no need for using hard currency in order to access\ngeo-blocked content. The service requires no account, emails or user names to use. Users access Yournet servers via anonymous\nengagement with surveys or ads.</p>\n<h3>Solution</h3>\n<p>The proposed solution is based on creating a Google Chrome extension that users will install and after interacting with an\nanonymous ad or survey they will be rewarded a certain amount of proxy access time. The extension has granular control giving the users\nthe ability to decide which browser tabs they need to proxy and select the country trough which they want their content to be proxied\ntrough.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe entire backend infrastructure is hosted on Amazon AWS making it scalable and easy to maintain and is built using\nInfrastructure as Code (IaC) processes, leveraging Terraform scripts for managing and provisioning computer data centers.</p>\n<h3>Features MVP:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Website</li>\n<li>Blog</li>\n<li>Solution for collecting user feedback</li>\n<li>Google Chrome extension</li>\n<li>Integrations with various ad/survey providers</li>\n<li>Multiple reward plans based on the duration of the ad/survey interaction </li>\n<li>Backend API</li>\n<li>Proxy servers network</li>\n<li>Monitoring for the proxy network</li>\n<li>AWS Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.766990291262136,"src":"/static/75e35e47e7947f6339aa6ea3d4b113d3/49b99/yournet-icon.png","srcSet":"/static/75e35e47e7947f6339aa6ea3d4b113d3/7c0ed/yournet-icon.png 200w,\n/static/75e35e47e7947f6339aa6ea3d4b113d3/49b99/yournet-icon.png 364w","sizes":"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px"}}},"projectName":"Yournet","projectShortDescription":"How we helped Yournet build a web proxy solution","title":"How we helped Yournet build a web proxy solution","date":"2020-12-31","testimonial":"I’ve worked with the BluePixel team on a couple of projects with the most recent one being Yournet.

Publishers were faced with the need to collect, store and respect\nuser consent in regards to the use of their personal data and users were seeking a way to manage their digital identity and decide\nwhich entities should have access to their personal data. In order to mitigate the publisher's risk of breaching GDPR, Oriel proposed\na SaaS solution for collecting and managing user consent.</p>\n<h3>Solution</h3>\n<p>The solution was based on the <a href=\"https://iabeurope.eu/tcf-for-cmps/\">Transparency &#x26; Consent Framework</a> (“TCF”)\nfor building a Consent Management Platform (“CMP”) offered by the <a href=\"https://www.iab.com/\">Interactive Advertising Bureau</a> (“IAB”).\nThe final solution contained the following:</p>\n<h6>CMP Widget</h6>\n<p>A configurable widget that the publisher would load inside the website. The TCF compliant widget was built using JavaScript and Preact\nand allowed users to give (or revoke) consent for the publisher to share the user's personal data with third parties. The widget offered\ngranular consent, meaning that the user is able to decide for which purposes his personal data will be used (E.g. Content selection, delivery, reporting, etc.)</p>\n<h6>Website Scanner</h6>\n<p>A tool that the publishers can use to scan their website in order to see if they are in breach of GDPR. The tool scans\nthe website and creates a report with all the cookies and trackers divided using a proprietary scoring algorithm into\n3 categories: High Risk, Medium Risk, and Low risk.</p>\n<h6>Oriel dashboard</h6>\n<p>A dashboard where the clients could customize the look and feel of the widget, configure the widget for each website they own,\nget a view of their website analytics, scan the website in order to see if they are GDPR compliant,\nsee billing details and upgrade/downgrade their pricing plan.</p>\n<h6>Oriel website</h6>\n<p>The company website, which was the main entry-point of the solution, provided the user with a light scan of their\nwebsite to see if they are GDPR compliant and a smooth onboarding process for the new customers.</p>\n<h3>Features:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Landing Page</li>\n<li>Onboarding tutorial and Tooltips Engine</li>\n<li>Overview / Dashboard with stats</li>\n<li>Aggregated stats - monthly, weekly, daily and hourly</li>\n<li>Payment system - SaaS with 4 different pricing plans (Stripe integration)</li>\n<li>Export XLS and CSV</li>\n<li>Freemium Access Capabilities / Limitations based on the current plan</li>\n<li>Email Notifications Engine</li>\n<li>Data Security (Encryption)</li>\n<li>Permissions</li>\n<li>Administration Panel (Users, Stats, Websites, etc)</li>\n<li>Tracking and Usage</li>\n<li>Support Center (via 3rd party Crisp)</li>\n<li>Cookie/Tracker Scanner</li>\n<li>Scoring cookies/tracking algorithm</li>\n<li>Consent Management Widget</li>\n<li>Localization support (for Widget)</li>\n<li>Multiple SDKs for easy installation of the CMP (PHP, Wordpress, Drupal, Python, Django, Java, and Node.js)</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.766990291262136,"src":"/static/bc9e534935aff1547584e847a9aa8256/49b99/oriel-icon.png","srcSet":"/static/bc9e534935aff1547584e847a9aa8256/7c0ed/oriel-icon.png 200w,\n/static/bc9e534935aff1547584e847a9aa8256/49b99/oriel-icon.png 364w","sizes":"(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px"}}},"projectName":"Oriel","projectShortDescription":"How we helped Oriel.io build their GDPR solution.","title":"How we helped Oriel.io build their GDPR solution","date":"2019-10-01","testimonial":"Oriel contracted the BluePixel team to help build our Consent Management Solution.
